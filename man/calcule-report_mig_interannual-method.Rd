\description{
Performs the calculation of seasonal coefficients for the plot(plot.type="seasonal") method. The numbers
are split according to the period chosen, one of "day","week","month","2 weeks", French labels are also 
accepted as arguments. Once this is done, the seasonality of the migration is displayed using the day when the 
first fish was seen, then the days (or period) corresponding to 5, 50 , 95, and 100 percent of the migration.
The duration of 90% of the migraton between Q5 and Q95 is also of interest.
}
\note{
The class report_mig does not handle escapement rates nor 
'devenir' i.e. the destination of the fishes.
