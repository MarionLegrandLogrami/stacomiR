	\code{uid}, \code{pwd} are identifier and password to connect to the database, they should
correspond to your own schema in the database. \code{pgwd} is the path to the R
source if you plan not to use the compiler but run manually using inst/config/stacomi_manual_launch.R for development.\cr
\code{datawd}, is the
directory where you want to place the outputs, mostly tables, from the
program, default to ~//CalcmigData 
\code{lang}, is either one of French, English or Spanish (deprecated)
