\note{
The choice method has for arguments a report (report) object
 (e.g) is called from a report report(e.g report_sample_char).
  By default,  the value of the objectreport is null.
  When it is not   the method calls daughter widgets (e.g. the dc widget will call species) 
and fills it with the method \link{charge_with_filter,ref_taxa-method}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{ 
win=gwindow()
group=ggroup(container=win,horizontal=FALSE)
object=new("ref_dc")
object<-charge(object)
objectreport=new("report_mig")
choice(object=object,objectreport=objectreport)
