\title{Loads additional data on migration control operations, df (fishway) dc (counting device).}
\usage{
\S4method{charge}{report_mig}(object, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{report_mig-class}}}

\item{silent}{Should the program be returning messages}
}
\value{
An object of class \link{report_mig-class} with slots filled by user choice
}
\description{
this method creates additional classes in envir_stacomi for later use in plot (operations, 
DF operation, DC operation). So unlike in most report classes where the charge method is only
used by the graphical interface, it is necessary to run charge for report_mig.
