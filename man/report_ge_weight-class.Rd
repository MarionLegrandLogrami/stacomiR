\title{Trend of wet weight in glass eel}
\description{
In trapping ladders, glass eel are seldom counted, as they are too tiny to handle and too numerous to count.
The usual operation is to weight them, or to use a bucket to measure their volume. These weights or volumes will later
need to be converted to numbers. The glass eel weight may follow a seasonal pattern. It's the case for Anguilla anguilla 
glass eel in the Bay of Biscay. Weights can be modelled using sine wave curves, or more complex gam models. 
This class has a model method to try those models, which can also be used to extact coefficients manually
to manually test more complex models.
Some plots are provided to display the coefficients stored in the database, and the model results. A parameter provided in 
the graphical interface or in the command line (slot liste) takes values "1", ">1", "tous" which mean respectively use
only individual sample of glass eels, or use "group weights" which can be more close to the real weight of glass eel
during counts as glass eel are not completely drained from their water during handling to preserve their mucus. The list choice
"tous" means that both individual and group weights are selected.

in the stacomi database are samples with a non null value for parent sample. Migration
counts are never made on subsamples but those can be integrated to calculate mean weights.}

In this class some tools are available to import glass eel measurement from
experimental fishing in the estuary. For the charge method dates for the
request are from august to august (a glass eel season)
