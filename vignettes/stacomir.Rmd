Introduction
--------------------------

Migratory fishes population are vulnerable as they are often more prone to human
impact when migrating in rivers and to the ocean ([McDowall,
1992](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.inee.bib.cnrs.fr/doi/10.1002/aqc.3270020405/pdf)). They are often counted at
stations when they perform the migrations at some of their lifestages, and these
counts provide valuable indices to the population size and trend. The objective
of the stacomi project is to provide a common database for people monitoring
fish migration, so that data from watershed are shared, and stocks exchanging
between different basins are better managed. The stacomi database, is an
open-source database, it managed with a JAVA interface, and results from that
database are treated directly with the stacomiR project.


Installation
-------------------------

The package is available from CRAN, a development version is available from
R-Forge.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# get the package from CRAN
install.packages("stacomiR") 
# get the development version
install.packages("stacomiR", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org") 
```

Usage
-------------------------

Launch the graphical interface

```{r , eval=FALSE}
stacomi()
```

The program can be launched to use from the command line

```{r , eval=FALSE}
stacomi(gr_interface = FALSE, login_window = TRUE, database_expected = TRUE)
```


Data structure
-------------------    
The open source postgresql database comprises a common schema with dictionaries,
and different schema for different users. Each user can save its own schema and
send it to others. The
database comprises tables related to infrastructure, operations and fish
samples. 
*Contact the authors to get a copy of the database*.

### Infrastructure


#### Station

A migration report is always built on a section of a river, this is called the
station. A station of fish migration monitoring is a section of a watercourse
where fish upstream or downstream migration is monitored. The station covers the
whole section of a single river, but can extend to several natural or artificial
channels. A station consists physically of as many dams as hydrographic sections
monitored (river, channels, etc.). According to the local settings, it
corresponds to one river location with a counting device, or to one or several
dams. For example, in the figure below we can see a station with three crossing device (DF 1 to 3)
and two counting device (DC 1 to 2), the first one beeing a trap counting device (DC1) and the other a video-counting device (DC2).

#### Dams
The concept of dam used in the context of fish migration monitoring database
refers to a system blocking or guiding the migratory flow like : 

* weir, 

* electric guide barrier, 

* netting dam, 

* etc.


#### Crossing device   
A crossing device (DF) is a passageway that allows and concentrates the
migratory flow between upstream and downstream sections of a dam. They can be of
various type :

* fishway, 

* spillway, 

* fish elevator,

* eel trapping ladder, 

* etc.

It is possible to have more than one crossing device on the same dam.

#### Counting device
A counting device (DC) is a set of equipment installed on a crossing device used
to monitor fish migration. It can be :

* a video counting device, 

* a trap, 

* an accoustic counting device, 

* ...


#### Monitoring operation
An operation corresponds to the monitoring of a counting device during a time
span. 

#### Sample
A sample corresponds to a batch of fishes passing during a monitoring operation.
Sample characteristics (length, weight, sex, body measurements) are attached to
the sample. For each sample the species and the stage (which corresponds to a
maturation stage and is related to migratory behaviour) is recorded. Samples
correspond to multiple fish of the same species and stage or to individual
records.

#### Other features
The database also handles, marking-recapture operations, pathologies, samples
collection (scale, fin sample for genetic...), fate of fishes (released, death,
farmed, etc.), etc... 
Some tables are also used to insert information
about environmental condition such as turbidity, atmospheric pressure,
temperature, flow ...


 Package structure
--------------------
The package relies on S4 classes. *Referential classes* are used to access data
from the database (taxa, stages, counting devices...).
*Report classes* are built from referential classes and have different methods
to access the database *connect methods*, generate calculations *calcule
method*, or plot results. 
For instance, the migration report class comprises slots for :

* DC The counting device (camera, trap, acoustic device...)

* taxa The species list from the database and the taxa selected

* stage The stages list from the database and the stage selected

* starting date The date of beginning

* ending date The last date of the report

Read the help files e.g. `? report_mig` to get documentation on the following
classes.

| Class         | Command    | description| 
| ------------- |:----------|:--------------------------------------- |

Working examples
-------------------------

### Command line

#### Migration report

Examples are provided with each of the class, you can access them simply by
typing `? report_mig_mult`.
The program is intented to be used in conjuntion with the database, to test it
without access, use the arguments `login_windows=FALSE` and
`database_expected=FALSE`.


```{r , eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
## launches the application in the command line without connection to the database
stacomi(gr_interface=FALSE,login_window=FALSE,database_expected=FALSE) 
```
The
following code is only run when there is a connection to the database. The
program will create an object of the class report_mig_mult, and run it for several DC, here 5 is a
vertical slot fishway, and 6 and 12 are two glass eel trapping ladder located
at the Arzal dam in the
Vilaine river (France).
We are evaluating the migration
of all stages of eel (glass eel CIV, yellow eel AGJ and silver eel AGG).
Glass
eel and yellow eel migrate to the watershed while silver eels
are migrating back
to the ocean.
Data are loaded from the database with the `charge` method and the `calcule`
method
will
interpolate
daily
migration from monitoring operations which do not necessarily span a day, and convert the glass eel
weight in numbers.


```{r ,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
   stacomi(gr_interface=FALSE,
	  login_window=FALSE,
	  database_expected=TRUE)	
  r_mig_mult=new("report_mig_mult")
  r_mig_mult=choice_c(r_mig_mult,
	  dc=c(5,6,12),
	  taxa=c("Anguilla anguilla"),
	  stage=c("AGG","AGJ","CIV"),
      datedebut="2011-01-01",
      datefin="2011-12-31")
  r_mig_mult<-charge(r_mig_mult)
  # launching charge will also load classes associated with the report
  # e.g. report_ope, report_df, report_dc
  r_mig_mult<-connect(r_mig_mult)
  # calculations 
  r_mig_mult<-calcule(r_mig_mult,silent=TRUE)
```

The previous line generates data not only about the report_mig_mult class,
but also runs dependent classes which describe how the fishway (DF) and counting
devices (DC) have been operated. Sometimes there are no data but only because
the camera was not working. There are also information about the operations
(e.g. periods at wich a trap content has been evaluated). Here we load what
would have been generated if we had run the previous lines.



One graph per DC, taxa and stage. 
Below as an example, the glass eel migration in weight and number (top),
the periods and type of operation for DF and DC, and the operation (trapping
periods) (middle), a summary of migration per month (bottom).


```{r rmmstd,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,fig.height=6,fig.with=8}
# Without a connection at the database we can launch these lines to generate the graph
# To obtain titles in french use Sys.setenv(LANG = "fr")
stacomi(gr_interface=FALSE,
	login_window=FALSE,
	database_expected=FALSE)	
data("r_mig_mult")
data("r_mig_mult_ope")
assign("report_ope",r_mig_mult_ope,envir=envir_stacomi)
data("r_mig_mult_df")
assign("report_df",r_mig_mult_df,envir=envir_stacomi)
data("r_mig_mult_dc")
assign("report_dc",r_mig_mult_dc,envir=envir_stacomi)
r_mig_mult<-calcule(r_mig_mult,silent=TRUE) 

# To avoid call to dev.new() which creates a device per stage, DC, taxa, we simplify 
# the object as dev.new() causes knitr to crash:
r_mig_mult@taxa@data<- r_mig_mult@taxa@data[1,]
r_mig_mult@stage@data<-r_mig_mult@stage@data[3,]
r_mig_mult@dc@dc_selectionne<-r_mig_mult@dc@dc_selectionne[3]

plot(r_mig_mult,plot.type="standard",silent=TRUE)

```

Summary of migration for different stages and counting devices

```{r rmmmult,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}

  plot(r_mig_mult,plot.type="multiple",silent=TRUE)
```


#### Silver eels

This section provides a short example for the function
calculating Durif's stages. Those maturity stages for silver eels are
calculated from body characteristics. The dataset `coef_durif`
corresponds to classification scores are calculated by multiplying the metrics
BL = body length, W = weight, MD = mean eye diameter (Dv+Dh)/2, and FL length of
the pectoral fin, with each parameter p as S=Constant+BL*p(bl)+W*p(W)... The
function `fun_stage_durif` choose the stage achieving the highest
score ([Durif et al.,
2009](http://fishlarvae.org/common/SiteMedia/durif%20et%20al%202009b.pdf))

```{r silver,eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6,fig.keep="all"}
require(stacomiR)
data("coef_durif")
# load a dataset of class report_silver_eel with data slot already prepared
# here is an example of output 
data("r_silver")
r_silver <- calcule(r_silver)
plot(r_silver, plot.type=3)
#######################################
# To use the function fun_stage_durif manually
# create a matrix with columns BL","W","Dv","Dh","FL"
#############################################
# here it is extracted from the data at hand
silver_eel<-as.matrix(r_silver@calcdata[[1]][,c("BL","W","Dv","Dh","FL")])
head(silver_eel) # to see the first lines
stage <- fun_stage_durif(silver_eel) # apply the function to the matrix
stage[1:10] # look at the first 10 elements in vector silver
```

### R-GTK2 graphical interface

The program is intended to be used by 'non experienced' R users. Launching
`stacomi()` will create the interface. The interface looks like :
